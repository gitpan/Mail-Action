=head1 NAME

Mail::Action::Address - roles applicable to individual addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mail::Action::Address;

    use Class::Roles
        does => 'address_expires',
        does => 'address_named',
        does => 'address_described';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most Mail::Action users operate around the idea of unique, lightweight e-mail
addresses, whether unique names within a subdomain, uniquely keyed variants of
a single address, or some combination of the two.

This class defines certain behavior and data storage features of those
addresses.  Use L<Class::Roles> to add these features to your own Address
classes.

=head1 ROLES

=head2 C<address_expires>

Allows Address instances to have an optional expiration date.  This adds two
method to the class to which you apply it:

=over 4

=item C<expires( $timestring )>

Gets and sets the time at which this Address will expire.  Set this time in a
simple text string, such as C<7d2h>.  Valid time units are:

=over 4

=item * C<m>, for minute.  This is sixty (60) seconds.

=item * C<h>, for hour.  This is sixty (60) minutes.

=item * C<d>, for day.  This is twenty-four (24) hours.

=item * C<w>, for week.  This is seven (7) days.

=item * C<M>, for month.  This is thirty (30) days.

The returned time is in epoch seconds.

=back

=item * C<process_time( $timestring )>

Turns a C<$timestring> into the number of seconds it represents.

=back

=head2 C<address_named>

Allows Address instances to have a name.  This adds one method to the class to
which you apply it:

=over 4

=item C<name( $name )>

Gets and sets the name associated with this Address.  This method strips the
name of all non-alphanumeric characters, including spaces and punctuation.

=back

=head2 C<address_described>

Allows Address instances to have a one-sentence description.  This adds one
method to the class to which you apply it:

=over 4

=item C<description( $description )>

Gets and sets the description of this Address.  This will return the empty
string if there is no description.

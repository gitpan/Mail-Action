Mail::Action README
-----------------------

Version 0.10

Mail::Action is a set of modules for building modules to perform actions based
on incoming messages.  See Mail::SimpleList and Mail::TempAddress for ideas.

INSTALLATION
------------

First, run the Build.PL file to create the Build program.  Then install as
normal:

	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ sudo ./Build install

All of the tests should pass.  If not, please send the complete diagnostic
output to the author and we'll try to fix the bugs.  This should work on any
Unix system and probably elsewhere, but that'll depend on several other
components.

USAGE
-----

This information is also contained within the POD of Mail::Action:

	$ perldoc Mail::Action

You'll have to write code.

ENHANCEMENTS
-------------

This is intended to contain code shared between Mail::SimpleList and
Mail::TempAddress.  It may grow slightly larger as I figure out better
approaches and as I come up with more ideas.
